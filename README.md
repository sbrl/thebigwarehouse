# The Big Warehouse
A collection of resources for programmers

This repository is like a 'big warehouse', and it contains a number of different 'big boxes'. Each big box contains a (growing!) number of related resources. Pull requests are always welcome :) Resources which have an excessive number of dependencies will not be accepted (except under special circumstances).
